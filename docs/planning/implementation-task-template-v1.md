# Mentor IB Implementation Task Template v1

**Date:** 2026-04-10
**Status:** Reusable implementation-task template for future AI agents and human reviewers
**Scope:** standard task shape, required source-doc links, scope boundaries, design/data/security/privacy/SEO checks, acceptance criteria, testing expectations, review notes, and anti-drift rules for turning the approved docs pack into build work

## 1. Why This Document Exists

Mentor IB now has enough design, architecture, data, SEO, privacy, and agent-index material to begin turning the docs into implementation work.

The next risk is not missing architecture.

The next risk is inconsistent task writing:

- tasks that say "build the page" without source docs
- agents reading the wrong docs for a feature
- UI tasks ignoring the design system
- data tasks skipping DTO, RLS, migration, or privacy review
- route tasks creating ad hoc API endpoints
- SEO tasks duplicating public-route acceptance rules
- privacy-sensitive tasks missing provider or retention review
- tests being added inconsistently or not at all

This template exists to prevent that.

## 2. How To Use This Template

Use this template when creating implementation tasks for:

- AI coding agents
- human implementation tickets
- review checklists
- phase 1 MVP work packages
- follow-up fixes that touch architecture-relevant boundaries

Do not use it as a source of truth for product behavior.

It is a task-writing format.

Source decisions still live in the dedicated docs named by the task.

## 3. Source-Of-Truth Rule

Every implementation task must name the source docs it depends on.

For routing to source docs, use:

- `docs/planning/agent-implementation-decision-index-v1.md`

For product build sequencing, use:

- `docs/planning/implementation-readiness-pack-v1.md`

For repo-wide navigation, use:

- `docs/README.md`

If the task conflicts with a dedicated source doc, the dedicated source doc wins and the task should be corrected before implementation.

## 4. Task Sizing Rule

Tasks should be small enough that an implementation agent can finish them with high accuracy.

Prefer tasks that have:

- one clear goal
- one primary route or component family
- one primary data boundary
- one test strategy
- one acceptance checklist
- a small set of files or folders likely to be touched

Avoid tasks that combine unrelated concerns such as:

- build design system, auth, database, and SEO in one task
- build all tutor pages at once
- implement messages plus notifications plus moderation plus Realtime in one task
- add public search plus matching ranking plus Algolia migration in one task
- create schema, UI, tests, privacy workflow, and policy copy in one task

Large work should be split into staged tasks.

## 5. Task Header Template

Use this header for every implementation task.

```md

## 7. Quick Intake Checklist

Before marking a task as ready, answer:

- Is the task small enough for one agent pass?
- Does it name the required source docs?
- Does it state what is out of scope?
- Does it identify likely files or folders?
- Does it identify whether the task is UI-only, data-affecting, route-affecting, privacy-affecting, SEO-affecting, or security-sensitive?
- Does it name the test expectation?
- Does it include acceptance criteria that can be reviewed?
- Does it avoid asking an agent to make product or legal decisions without a source doc?

If any answer is no, the task is still a draft.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria Rules

Acceptance criteria should be observable.

Good examples:

- "The `/tutors/[slug]` route renders only approved public profile fields from a public DTO."
- "The message send action rejects non-participants and does not log message bodies."
- "The booking action records a durable booking request and returns a minimal operation result."
- "The route includes metadata and noindex/canonical behavior required by the route class."
- "The component uses approved design tokens and has mobile behavior matching the final design-system spec."

Weak examples:

- "Make it nice."
- "Implement the page."
- "Add auth."
- "Improve SEO."
- "Use best practices."

If acceptance criteria cannot be reviewed, the task is not ready.

## 10. Test Expectation Rules

Every task should state one of:

- automated test required
- manual verification sufficient
- no test required with reason

Use these defaults:

- UI component tasks need component, visual, or manual responsive verification depending the available test stack.
- public route tasks need SEO/public-route checklist verification.
- Server Actions need validation/auth/result-shape tests when meaningful.
- Route Handlers need method/auth/signature/response tests when meaningful.
- database changes need database tests when they affect RLS, constraints, projections, functions, triggers, or migrations.
- privacy-sensitive changes need exposure/export/deletion verification where relevant.
- messaging changes need participant-access and denied-access coverage.

Do not let "no test required" be a silent default.

## 11. Review Checklist Rules

Task reviewers should check:

- source docs were listed and are relevant
- implementation stayed inside scope
- no unrelated user changes were reverted
- no generic internal API layer was introduced
- no separate student/tutor UI world was created
- no hardcoded design token, status, reference data, or legal copy was introduced without review
- no sensitive data was exposed in DTOs, logs, analytics, metadata, or public routes
- tests or verification match the task risk
- docs were updated only when a source-of-truth decision changed

## 12. Anti-Patterns

Avoid task statements like:

- "Build all auth."
- "Implement database."
- "Create the full tutor dashboard."
- "Add messaging."
- "Make SEO work."
- "Use the docs as needed."
- "Update anything necessary."

Prefer:

- "Implement role selection Server Action and setup route guard using the auth matrix and API boundary docs."
- "Create the public tutor profile read DTO and route skeleton, without booking actions."
- "Add baseline `app_users` and profile tables with RLS review and database tests."
- "Implement message send domain command and Server Action, without Realtime typing indicators."

The narrower form gives agents a much better chance of doing the right work.

## 13. When To Split A Task

Split the task if it touches more than one of these in a substantial way:

- design-system primitives
- route layout
- schema migration
- RLS policy
- domain service
- Server Action
- Route Handler
- public SEO metadata
- privacy/DSR behavior
- provider integration
- Realtime behavior
- background jobs

Some slices can still include multiple layers when the work is small and coherent.

Example:

- a small form can include component usage, a Server Action, validation, and one test

But split when the task starts to hide more than one independent decision.

## 14. Documentation Update Rule

Implementation tasks should not rewrite docs by default.

Update docs only when:

- implementation reveals an approved decision is incomplete
- a new source-of-truth decision is approved
- a provider or data category changes
- an architecture boundary changes
- a new reusable pattern is introduced
- a checklist or decision index is now wrong

If a task only implements an existing decision, cite the source docs in the completion summary instead of editing docs.

## 15. Completion Summary Template

Every implementation agent should finish with:

```md
## Completion Summary

Implemented:

- <high-signal summary>

Verification:

- `<command>` passed
- `<manual check>` completed
- Not run: <reason>

Source docs used:

- `<path>`
- `<path>`

Notes:

- <follow-up, risk, or none>
```

## 16. Final Recommendation

Mentor IB should use this task template before writing real build tickets.

The operating model is:

- decision index routes agents to source docs
- task template turns those docs into small implementation slices
- each task names source docs, scope, boundaries, acceptance criteria, and verification
- source docs change only when decisions change

This should let future AI agents work quickly without turning the approved architecture into guesswork.
