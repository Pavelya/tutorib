# Mentor IB Phase 2 Task Pack v1

**Date:** 2026-04-10
**Status:** Broad but execution-usable Phase 2 task pack for future AI agents
**Scope:** tutor application and listing quality, deeper tutor management, lesson-linked trust and continuity, richer internal operations, richer messaging behavior, and conditional growth/scaling work after the core product is stable

## 1. Why This Document Exists

Mentor IB now has:

- an active Phase 1 MVP execution pack
- a bounded Phase 1.5 pack
- a master backlog index
- a decision index for routing implementation work to the right source docs

What still needs definition is the next layer after the core product loop is stable:

**Which product areas belong in Phase 2, and which of them are concrete enough to implement versus only concrete enough to reserve?**

Phase 2 matters because it is where the product stops being only:

- first match
- first booking
- first conversation

and starts becoming a stronger operating system for:

- tutor supply and approval
- tutor quality and visibility
- post-lesson continuity
- internal trust and moderation work
- selected scale and growth pressures

At the same time, this phase should not pretend that every later idea is equally ready.

This document exists to keep Phase 2 broad where it should stay broad, and specific where the current docs pack is already strong enough to support implementation.

## 2. How To Use This Pack

Use this pack after the relevant Phase 1 and Phase 1.5 foundations are stable enough to support it.

The workflow is:

1. confirm whether the Phase 2 need is product-driven, operationally necessary, or threshold-triggered
2. open this pack to find the right Phase 2 lane
3. use `docs/planning/agent-implementation-decision-index-v1.md` to confirm source docs
4. use `docs/planning/implementation-task-template-v1.md` when a task needs tracker-grade expansion
5. keep any route, DTO, or policy change inside approved boundaries rather than inventing a new subsystem

This pack is intentionally broader than Phase 1 and Phase 1.5.

That is not a bug.

It reflects the fact that some Phase 2 work is already well-defined, while some should remain conditional until real implementation or usage reveals the right shape.

## 3. Phase 2 Entry Conditions

Phase 2 should begin only when the relevant earlier foundations exist in a usable form.

Required baseline:

- shared student and tutor route families are stable
- tutor public profile and booking foundations exist
- messages and lessons exist as shared continuity objects
- tutor operations are usable enough to support real tutor workflows
- compare and tutor students are either implemented or intentionally deferred with the underlying objects still stable

Additional practical triggers:

- tutor supply growth now requires a real application and approval workflow
- tutors need clearer control over listing quality, credentials, and public media
- real lessons create pressure for reviews or post-lesson continuity records
- message volume or support pressure justifies richer message behavior
- internal operations become too manual to stay outside the product
- browse-search or query latency crosses the approved thresholds

Do not start threshold-triggered growth work just because it is listed here.

Start it when the trigger exists.

## 4. What Phase 2 Covers

Phase 2 is the first broader product-expansion phase.

Its expected areas are:

- tutor application and approval flow
- deeper tutor profile and listing management
- credential, public media, and intro video management
- lesson-linked reviews and trust expansion
- post-lesson reports and continuity signals
- richer messaging behavior
- internal tutor-review and moderation operations
- growth or scaling work only when thresholds justify it

## 5. Phase 2 Non-Goals

Phase 2 should not include by default:

- native mobile apps
- custom video meeting infrastructure
- a full payout or billing platform
- a giant generic admin suite
- a broad data warehouse or BI program
- automatic self-optimizing ranking
- a mandatory Algolia migration
- file attachments in messaging unless a dedicated product need is approved
- broad SEO route expansion by default

## 6. Status And Priority Vocabulary

Use:

- `ready`: concrete enough to implement when it becomes active priority
- `draft`: valid and useful, but still needs sharper interaction, route, or sequencing choices
- `planned`: intentionally reserved and should only start when a trigger condition exists
- `done`: implemented and verified

Priority:

- `P1`: major Phase 2 product expansion work
- `P2`: important operational or quality work
- `P3`: conditional growth or scaling work

## 7. Planning Posture For Phase 2

Unlike Phase 1, this pack should not force fake certainty.

The practical rule is:

- keep user-facing supply and trust work relatively concrete
- keep internal operations and richer communication work more provisional unless the team is actively entering that lane
- keep growth and scaling work conditional, not default

If a task depends on a route that is not yet explicitly approved in the route map, keep it as `draft` until that route decision is made or revised deliberately.

## 8. Execution Waves

Use this as the default order.

## 8.1 Wave 1: Tutor supply and listing quality

Goal:

- make tutor onboarding, profile quality, and listing readiness feel deliberate, supportive, and reviewable

## 8.2 Wave 2: Trust and continuity expansion

Goal:

- extend the product beyond one-off lessons through reviews, reports, and stronger trust surfaces

## 8.3 Wave 3: Privileged operations and richer communication

Goal:

- support internal admin review and trust work, and expand messaging only where the product now clearly benefits

## 8.4 Wave 4: Growth and scaling

Goal:

- respond to real performance or growth pressure without prematurely locking the product into heavier infrastructure

## 9. Parallel Work Rule

Parallel work is allowed only when the write scopes are meaningfully disjoint.

Good parallel examples:

- tutor application UX work and lesson-review domain work
- internal moderation queue planning and public tutor media pipeline work
- threshold monitoring work and user-facing Phase 2 UI work

Bad parallel examples:

- two agents editing the same tutor application state model
- review publication work before review eligibility and moderation boundaries are settled
- Algolia-readiness work mixed with active matching logic changes

- `docs/architecture/testing-and-release-architecture-v1.md`
- `docs/architecture/observability-and-incident-architecture-v1.md`
- `docs/architecture/security-architecture-v1.md`
- `docs/architecture/accessibility-and-inclusive-ux-architecture-v1.md`
- `docs/architecture/compliance-and-regulatory-posture-v1.md`

**Scope**

- final cross-lane verification
- unresolved risk and blocker summary
- operational readiness for any newly added privileged or public-facing Phase 2 surfaces

**Out of scope**

- new Phase 3 product ideation
- unrelated refactor work

**Acceptance criteria**

- privilege-sensitive routes and mutations have explicit verification outcomes
- public trust or media surfaces are reviewed for correctness and exposure safety
- any conditional growth work is justified by evidence
- unresolved blockers are named clearly rather than hidden

**Verification**

- checklist-driven review across the named source docs

## 12. Task Drafting Rules For Follow-Up

If a `draft` task becomes the active build priority:

- confirm whether route changes are already approved or need an explicit route-map revision
- expand it through `docs/planning/implementation-task-template-v1.md`
- keep the workstream coherent instead of mixing multiple Phase 2 lanes together

If a `planned` task becomes necessary:

- first document the trigger condition
- then promote it to `draft` or `ready`

## 13. What Should Happen Next

After this Phase 2 pack:

1. treat the canonical phase task-pack set as complete
2. keep Phase 1 as the active implementation source unless priorities explicitly shift
3. create any new planning artifact only if execution reveals a real navigation or coordination problem

## 14. Final Recommendation

Mentor IB should treat this pack as the broad expansion map for the first post-MVP platform phase.

The operating model is:

- Wave 1 strengthens tutor supply and listing quality
- Wave 2 turns lessons into stronger trust and continuity objects
- Wave 3 adds internal operating discipline and selectively richer communication
- Wave 4 responds to real scaling pressure without abandoning the match-first architecture

That keeps Phase 2 ambitious enough to matter, while still protecting the project from generic marketplace sprawl and premature infrastructure complexity.
